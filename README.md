# UnitConv

UnitConv is a SwiftUI-based iOS application designed as a comprehensive unit conversion tool, demonstrating modern iOS development practices with Swift's Foundation framework. The app provides seamless length unit conversions with real-time calculations, intuitive interface design, and precise measurement handling.

## Overview

**UnitConv** allows users to:
* Enter any numeric value for conversion
* Select from 5 different length units (Meters, Kilometers, Feet, Yards, Miles)
* Choose both input and output units independently
* Instantly view converted results with high precision
* Experience a clean, modern interface with visual unit representations

The app leverages SwiftUI's declarative syntax and Apple's robust `Measurement` API, ensuring accuracy while providing an exceptional user experience with responsive design and intuitive controls.

## Features

* **Comprehensive Unit Support:** Convert between Meters, Kilometers, Feet, Yards, and Miles with full bidirectional capability.
* **Real-Time Conversion:** Instant results as you type, powered by computed properties.
* **Precision Accuracy:** Uses Foundation's `Measurement` framework for scientifically accurate conversions.
* **Smart Input Handling:** Decimal keyboard with convenient "Done" toolbar button.
* **Visual Design:** Colorful SF Symbol icons representing each unit type for enhanced user experience.
* **Modern SwiftUI Architecture:** Utilizes `NavigationStack`, segmented pickers, and form-based layout.

## Getting Started

This repository demonstrates advanced SwiftUI concepts including state management, computed properties, and Foundation framework integration. **The source code is provided for learning, portfolio demonstration, and educational purposes.**

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 13.0 or later
- iOS 15.0+
- Swift 5.5+

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `UnitConv.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Build and run on your preferred device or simulator

## Usage

1. **Enter Value:** Input the measurement you want to convert using the decimal keypad.
2. **Select Input Unit:** Choose your starting unit from the segmented picker (Meters, KM, Feet, Yard, Miles).
3. **Select Output Unit:** Pick your desired conversion unit from the second segmented picker.
4. **View Results:** The converted value appears instantly in the "Computed output" section.

## Code Highlights

* **Advanced State Management:** Implements `@State` for reactive UI updates and `@FocusState` for keyboard management.
* **Computed Properties:** The `computedOutput` property demonstrates complex conditional logic with real-time calculations.
* **Foundation Integration:** Leverages `Measurement` and `UnitLength` classes for precise, standardized conversions.
* **Clean Architecture:** Well-structured SwiftUI views with proper separation of concerns.
* **Modern UI Components:** 
  - Segmented pickers for unit selection
  - Form-based layout with clear sections
  - Toolbar integration for enhanced UX
  - Visual branding with colorful SF Symbols

### Supported Conversions

The app supports all combinations between:
- **Meters** (m) - SI base unit
- **Kilometers** (km) - Metric system
- **Feet** (ft) - Imperial system  
- **Yards** (yd) - Imperial system
- **Miles** (mi) - Imperial system

## Technical Implementation

The core conversion logic utilizes Swift's `Measurement` framework, ensuring:
- **Accuracy:** Scientific precision in all calculations
- **Performance:** Efficient real-time computation
- **Maintainability:** Clean, readable code structure
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new units or measurement types
